# Fish_foodwebs 

Fish foodwebs presents the code used to predict the global occurence and productivity of different fish guilds in a food-web context using the fish traits of
maximum body weight and vertical habitat strategy (FEISTY-VerticalTrait).

Each folder contains the full model and can be run separately. A simple run can be done by downloading the "simple run" folder. 

The global model (folder global model parfor) is run in parallel to speed up the code.
